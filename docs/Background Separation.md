# Background Separation
---
Separate the moving foreground from static background. We have built a robust testing system for the evaluation of different algorithms that are pre-implemented in OpenCV library.
The current implementation includes:
- KNN
- CNT
- LSBP
- GSOC
- MOG2
- MOG
- GMG

## Results

## To-Do
---
- [ ] Implement [[Robust Principle Component Analysis]].
- [ ] Explain the working of pre-implemented algorithms.
- [ ] Check for other algorithms and ML models for the same.
- [ ] Fine tune the hyperparameters for above algorithms
- [ ] Explore the use in our project.
